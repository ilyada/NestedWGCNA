# NestedWGCNA

**Note:** This repository is for an upcoming publication about the modified version of the WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) algorithm. The publication is currently in progress and will be available soon.

## Description

NestedWGCNA is an enhanced version of the WGCNA algorithm aimed at providing more accurate and efficient co-expression network inference for bulk transcriptomics data analysis. This repository contains the implementation of the method, along with an example pipeline for users to apply it to their own data.
